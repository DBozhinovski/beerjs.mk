---

With some delay (we really needed some rest), we are finally publishing the videos and slides from BeerJS's birthday
edition. 🎂

We celebrated the birthday with a truly wonderful event. We hope that everyone who was there had fun and enjoyed
themselves. This wasn't the largest event this year, but a significant part of the audience stayed until the end. The
engagement with questions was at a really high level, which is a testament of the quality of the presentations and the
presenters we had. 🍻

Once again, there were no serious technical issues (although the audio was problematic in the back). Our stream got
interrupted at one point, and we lost the introduction in Mitko's presentation. Fortunately, we have the rest. There was
also a live broadcast on YouTube - [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xidzTs9FM30),
[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCFApGMKRmw) for all those who were not able to attend.
