With Vol. 12, we made a return to the "big" format with three speakers. The event was great; this time, in contrast to
previous ones, we adhered relatively strictly to the schedule, and I personally think it worked well. We hope the event
was interesting to the audience as well – judging by the participation, we feel like it was 🍻

Behind the scenes, we didn't have any technical issues (a first in the history of BeerJS Skopje 😅), and we managed to
set up for the event in record time. It was interesting to see that we've genuinely improved (as
[DeveD](https://deved.mk)) in this aspect.

Again, we had a live broadcast on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iTR3IzTkQw) for those who couldn't attend.
A huge thank you to our sponsor, [Kin+Carta](https://www.kinandcarta.com/en/), for their support.
