We kicked off our first event of the year on March 30th at Public Room, and we were thrilled to see a great turnout! The
audience engagement keeps growing, and we couldn't be happier about it ❤️ 🍻

We had a few minor technical difficulties with volume levels on stage and on the
[live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBhyxyR_8M4), but we managed to pull through and deliver another fantastic
event. A big thank you to our sponsor, [CodeChem](https://codechem.com), for their support and the awesome swag they
provided!
