The second event this year "rocked" with attendance, and frankly, you left us speechless! The audience's activity keeps
growing, and we are happy about that ❤️ 🍻

We didn't have any serious technical difficulties this time, and we think the audio quality was at a decent level
(except for those in the back, more on that in the next post). The
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OZ8Px8Shmc) stream had similarly decent audio, and we received feedback that
the slides should be visible in the stream as well. We completely agree, and we will fix that at vol. 11. All in all, we
think the event went great. A big thank you to our sponsor, [DEPT](https://deptagency.com) for their support.

This time we enjoyed three interesting presentations:

### 1. "GraphQL API with NestJS & CQRS" - **Kristina Spasevska**
