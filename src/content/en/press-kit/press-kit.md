## Description

Beer.js Skopje, organized under the [DeveD](https://deved.mk) umbrella, and a part of the global Beer.js organization,
is a meetup designed for beer and JavaScript enthusiasts. While enjoying beer is not mandatory, the event aims to bring
together like-minded individuals interested in technology and networking.

The Skopje chapter of Beer.js features a structured format, with three presenters typically sharing JavaScript-related
topics in 25-30 minute sessions. We encourage anyone interested in giving a talk to contact us at
[hello@beerjs.mk](mailto:hello@beerjs.mk) or through our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BeerjsSk) and
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/beerjsskopje) pages.

For inquiries about event suggestions, general discussions, sponsorship opportunities, or donations, please reach out
via email or by creating a new issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/beerjs/skopje) page.

Although Beer.js has an informal atmosphere, we maintain a commitment to the
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/) to ensure a safe and inclusive environment for all
attendees. Any grievances or CoC breaches should be reported to [hello@beerjs.mk](mailto:hello@beerjs.mk).

We are always open to new supporters. By fostering collaboration and learning within the local tech community, Beer.js,
as part of the [DeveD](https://deved.mk) initiative, aims to create a positive and lasting impact.
