As last time, we have some t-shirts available. The t-shirts are pay-what-you-want (with a minimum of 1200 mkd). ~60% of all the collected funds are allocated for administrative expenses (new t-shirts, stickers, swag, accounting, etc.) while the other 40% are allocated for a new camera at „Base42“. The goal is ~750 eur to buy a [sony zv-e10](https://electronics.sony.com/imaging/interchangeable-lens-cameras/aps-c/p/ilczve10-b?srsltid=AfmBOoqg7k4Fk-LRwLBub6ajmc86rvVLqDFBGkTiDjKto1oyRqpRvjJA) kit, with dummy battery and a cooler. Of course, the new camera is for all of the communities who use "Base42".

See you on the 30th 🍻
