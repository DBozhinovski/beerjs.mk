## Presentations

1. **Shaders in ThreeJS** - Ivan Lazarevski
   
   Shaders are small programs that run directly on the GPU and control how 3D graphics are drawn, such as how vertices are positioned and how pixels are colored. WebGL uses shaders to create lighting, materials, textures, shadows, and visual effects efficiently in real time. They’re written in GLSL, a C-like language designed specifically for parallel execution on the GPU. Three.js often hides shader complexity with built-in materials, but custom shaders give you full control over how your scene looks (and this is what we're looking at today).

2. **Bun: JS is Moving Beyond Node** - Petar Atanasovski
   
   For over a decade, Node.js has been the undisputed king of server-side JS, but the tools we use to build for the web are fundamentally changing. This talk explores how Bun’s single-binary approach, unifying the runtime, package manager, and bundler, is challenging the long-standing Node.js status quo.

3. **AWS CDK - the IaC toolkit in typescript** - Damjan Georgievski
   
   AWS CDK is an open-source IaC tool that allows you to define your cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages (like TypeScript, Python, or Java) instead of complex configuration files, and then deploys it via AWS CloudFormation.
