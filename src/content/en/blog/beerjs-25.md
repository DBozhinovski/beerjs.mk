## BeerJS, GameDev edition 🎮

Do you have a killer instinct or are you a "killer programmer"? 🤔
Or maybe you prefer to have a life in your 20s? (skill issue).

Regardless of whether you've been "sat down" for a chat recently, or you might be thinking of taking an internship with a CEO _without paying them_, you're welcome to join us for the 25th edition of BeerJS Skopje.

We'll have beer. Free, of course. The 25th edition will be dedicated to game development in the context of JavaScript. Details about the presentations coming soon 🍻
