description: Towards a better BeerJS Skopje and a better Macedonian IT scene üçª

As we announced a few weeks ago on social media, the team behind BeerJS Skopje decided to establish a civil association.
We finally completed the process this morning. Therefore, as of today, Deved (website coming soon) is the official
entity running BeerJS Skopje.

## Why a civil association? ü§î

The motive for this is, above all, practical. A civil association means having a legal entity with a bank account that
can easily receive and distribute funds from event sponsorships and all BeerJS-related activities. I believe that most
readers will agree that "pay an invoice to X and Y" when negotiating a sponsorship does not sound too professional. In
fact, it has also happened that we do not get a response after we say what it means to sponsor an event.

Additionally, having an association provides better ways to avoid situations where a sponsor cancels days before the
event. Fortunately, we haven't had many such situations, but we've definitely learned our lesson.

As always, we remain 100% transparent with every activity.

Apart from the practical aspect, I am convinced that (educational) non-profit organizations are vital to developing our
IT scene. The reason is simple - you eliminate profit as the primary motive. Education, creating contacts and relations
with professionals and enthusiasts, etc. Of course, we can't pay bills with enthusiasm, and finances will be part of the
story. But I want to emphasize that they will never be the primary motive and driver of Deved and BeerJS (same as
before).

## What does that mean for BeerJS Skopje? ü§î

From a guest's point of view, absolutely nothing. The event you know from 2017 remains the same. Quality and
organization will remain the same and, hopefully, better. We are happy that there are more and more events and
activities in the Macedonian IT scene. BeerJS (and Deved) remain committed to supporting all local events, workshops,
and activities that make us better as an industry.

For all sponsors and supporters, establishing Deved means a faster and simpler way to support the event and our
activities. We are working on a sponsorship and support document that will be made public soon (we are very serious
about that 100% transparency bit).

Additionally, we are planning other types of events and activities for which we will publish the information soon. One
of those activities is [CodePub](https://codepub.dev) - an IT podcast focused on the people working in the industry.

Finally, I would like to thank you all for coming to our events, supporting us, and writing to us on
[social media](/contact), being active on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/KFwsH7jc) ...

BeerJS and Deved exist for you ‚ù§Ô∏è üçª
