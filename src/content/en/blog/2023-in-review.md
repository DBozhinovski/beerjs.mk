description: A retrospective of BeerJS Skopje through 2023, news, and plans.
---

By every measure, 2023 was the most productive year for BeerJS Skopje since our founding in 2017. We had a total of
eight events this year. Four of them were in the known (large) format, where we introduced three speakers per event,
instead of the previous two. We also started the "0.33" format, where the idea was to have fewer speakers and a more
informal event without a strict agenda. One of the smaller events we even held in Ohrid, which was a really great
experience.

However, due to the large number of interested speakers, the smaller events began to have three speakers as well, and
somehow the lines between what is a small and large event got blurred. The smaller events are significantly less work
for the team, and the experience for the audience and speakers is almost the same. Guided by this and the positive
feedback from the audience, we decided to make the small (0.33) events our default, and to hold the larger ones twice a
year.

But, the big events will be bigger. Our plan is for them to be in a more conference-like format, with the presence of
international speakers and a wider range of activities. Namely, for all those who asked us for workshops throughout
2023, your wish will be fulfilled in 2024.

As always, your opinion means a lot to us, and we would be very grateful if you could
[fill out the feedback survey](https://forms.gle/K6JR2EHdhqLnUUt67) and leave us your opinion on our plans for 2024.

## BeerJS 0.33 vol. 4

The last event of the year was really special. In addition to interesting topics, audience activity was at a record high
level, so much so that we had to limit the number of questions and time for discussion. [Base42](https://42.mk) once
again proved to be an excellent place for this type of event. As we announced at the event, our collaboration with them
continues in 2024 - all 0.33 events will be held there.

If you were not able to attend the event, you can have a look at the presentations on our
[YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScyJr3W0-BFCrPW1kLcGmQ).

## 2023 in Numbers

Expressed in numbers, 2023 looked like this for BeerJS Skopje:

- 8 events
- 20 presentations
- ~18 hours of video material
- ~3,500 liters of beer consumed
- ~230 attendees at the largest event of the year
- ~150 average attendance at large events
- ~50 average attendance at small events
- 4.4 average rating for organization
- 4.3 average rating for presentations

## Plan for 2024

As before, we continue with a similar volume of events, with different distribution. Our current idea is:

- 2 large BeerJS events, in an even larger format, with more content and activities.
- 4 small BeerJS events, in the known format - 2 or 3 speakers, informal atmosphere, and no strict agenda. If there is
  interest for more of these, we're willing to increase the number.

However, we also have several ideas for new events. Inspired by BeerJS, but under the guidance of
[DeveD](https://deved.mk), so as not to "dilute" the idea of BeerJS:

- 2x panel discussions. Hint: if you were at BeerJS 0.33 vol. 4 at the
  [presentation about HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SDf8LvwiUU), you know what to expect. The first one will
  happen soon üòâ
- Workshops / Bootcamps. We already have ideas for topics and speakers, but if you have any ideas or suggestions, please
  share them on the [feedback form](https://forms.gle/K6JR2EHdhqLnUUt67).
- A wider range of digital content - [CodePub](https://codepub.dev) will transform into something bigger and better.
  Namely, the idea is for it to become closer to a media outlet than a podcast. In addition to the familiar interview
  format with which we experimented in 2023, we are also working on two new formats that you will see in February 2024.
  With much better production üòâ

## In Conclusion

Above all, we would like to thank you, the community around BeerJS Skopje (and by extension, DeveD). We would not be
where we are without you. We hope to continue to grow and have fun together in 2024.

We would also like to thank all of our sponsors and partners for their continuous support of our activities.
