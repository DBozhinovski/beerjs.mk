---

In several previous blog posts, we mentioned that we are thinking about other types of events (and activities in
general). At last, the time has come to reveal one of these ideas. üéâ

We are happy to announce BeerJS 0.33. üçª

![033-01](/img/033-vol-1.png)

## What is BeerJS 0.33?

An even more informal (and smaller) remix of the BeerJS you know. The idea of the event is:

- No agenda
- No big promotional campaigns
- If someone wants to give a talk about something, we have equipment
- If you want to discuss projects, issues with JS/web development, need advice on something related to your work, or
  want to meet people from the same field, this is the event for you
- We do not have sponsorships (we don‚Äôt refuse them, but we are not actively looking for them for 0.33)
- In the context of the previous point, BYOB (bring your own beer). We also have some in the fridge, but please bring
  some to avoid running run out üòÖ

We're limited with space, so please sign up on our [discord server](https://discord.gg/sxNCQmA7aP) (look for the post in
`#announcements`)

The first edition will take place today, on 29.06.2023, starting at 19:00.
