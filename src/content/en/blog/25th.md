Instead of a classic retrospective on 2024, we'll do something a bit different this time. In 2024, we did relatively well - despite the fact that [2023 was more productive](/2023-in-review) (at least in terms of number of BeerJS events).

## What did we do in 2024?

In 2024, we had 5 BeerJS events:

- üóìÔ∏è 2024-02-29 - [BeerJS 0.33 vol. 5](/announcements/033-vol5-announcement)
- üóìÔ∏è 2024-04-26 - [BeerJS 0.33 vol. 6](/announcements/033-vol6-announcement)
- üóìÔ∏è 2024-05-30 - [BeerJS 0.33 vol. 7](/announcements/033-vol7-announcement)
- üóìÔ∏è 2024-11-07 - [BeerJS 0.33 vol. 8](/announcements/033-vol8-announcement)
- üóìÔ∏è 2024-12-12 - [BeerJS 0.33 vol. 9](/announcements/033-vol9-announcement)

Each took place at [Base42](https://42.mk) and they were pretty packed. We stopped counting attendees a while ago, but we can say that Base42 was full at each event.

As always, the recordings are available on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCScyJr3W0-BFCrPW1kLcGmQ).

Besides BeerJS, we also organized a panel discussion ([State of the Stacks](https://stateofthestacks.deved.mk)), and in collaboration with [Base42](https://42.mk) and [Angular Macedonia](https://www.angularmacedonia.org) we also organized the first independent web development conference in Macedonia - [WhatTheStack](https://wts.sh).

## The times they are a-changin'

In the interest of transparency and efficiency of the organization, we will introduce some changes:

We're not going to accept sponsorships from now on, for some practical reasons. Sponsorships, in the shape in which they are legally defined and the amount of work that needs to be done to get them, are just too much. If you want to support us, you can do so by donating (either money or beer), and we'll gladly accept that. Give us a ping at [hello@beerjs.mk](mailto:hello@beerjs.mk). In short, we're still open to donations (simply because they don't involve extra work from our side), regardless of whether they're bank transfers to our account or in the donation box at Base42. We prefer the latter, for a simple reason - the donation box is for every event that takes place at Base42. As a community that is part of the larger IT community in Macedonia, we're aware that not everyone has the audience and sponsorship opportunities that we do. We believe in the "pay it forward" idea, and we think that there should be more healthy IT communities which won't think about whether the event "has beer" (or whatever else it needs to have).

And speaking of beer, of course there will still be beer at BeerJS, no worries üòÅ. If you want to help us out with that, bring some, and we'll gladly accept it - Base42 has plenty of space for it.

## What are our plans for 2025?

...which brings us to the title of this post. The title is 25, because the next edition of BeerJS will be the 25th one, and it will take place in 2025. Since we've been doing this for a while now, we decided to unify the numbering of the events. From now on, there will be only one BeerJS, and it will be BeerJS from now on. The announcement for BeerJS 25 is coming soon. As always, we'll continue to organize BeerJS in Base42.

The idea to unify the numbering of the events is inspired by the fact that BeerJS is primarily a meetup format. Conferences are a lot more work, and we think that one per year, which will be a really big one (like [WhatTheStack](https://wts.sh)), is enough.

In 2025, you can expect 5 BeerJS events, WhatTheStack vol. 2, State of the Stacks (which we'll do as part of WhatTheStack)... and maybe some other stuff too üòâ
