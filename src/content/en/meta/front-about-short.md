Beer.js is a meetup for beer and JavaScript enthusiasts. Everyone is welcome! Drinking beer, despite being in the title
is not mandatory for participation. Beer.js Skopje has been active since 2017 and acts independently of commercial
entities - we are not part of a company. Since 2023, Beer.js Skopje is under the stewardship of
[DeveD](https://deved.mk), a non-profit organization whose primary goal is IT education and promotion of the Macedonian
IT industry. [More about BeerJS](/about)
