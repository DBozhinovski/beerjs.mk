## What's BeerJS?

Beer.js is a meetup for beer and JavaScript enthusiasts. Everyone is welcome! Drinking beer, despite being in the title,
is not mandatory for participation :)

The event has no official format. The Skopje branch of Beer.js has three presentations per event, with topics
that are at least somehow related to JavaScript, with a duration of 25-30 minutes. Signing up to give a talk at the
event is simple - feel free to contact us at [hello@beerjs.mk](mailto:hello@beerjs.mk) or on any of the
[social networks](/en/contact).

Suggestions about the event, general discussion, interest in sponsorships, beer donations - to the above email or by
creating a new issue on [github](https://github.com/beerjs/skopje).

Despite the unofficial nature of the event, Beer.js has one official rule: adherence to the
[Citizen Code of Conduct](http://citizencodeofconduct.org/). Any grievances and CoC breaches should be reported at
[hello@beerjs.mk](mailto:hello@beerjs.mk).

We are open to new supporters at any time, especially if they are interested in beer donations! :)

## Who runs BeerJS Skopje?

BeerJS Skopje is run by [DeveD](https://deved.mk).

## How can I join?
